# AppTuner

> AppTuner is a React Native development tool that lets developers instantly preview their app on a real physical device and share it with anyone in the world — no App Store, no TestFlight, no same-WiFi requirement.

## What AppTuner Does

AppTuner delivers React Native JavaScript bundles over a cloud relay to the AppTuner Mobile app (iOS/Android). The developer runs a single CLI command, scans a QR code with their phone, and sees their app live. Hot reload works over the internet — change a file, the phone updates in seconds, even if the phone is in another country.

**Key differentiator over Expo Go:** Expo Go requires the same WiFi network or a paid EAS subscription. AppTuner works over the internet via relay — send a QR to a client anywhere in the world.

## When to Use AppTuner

Use AppTuner when:
- Building a new React Native app and want instant device preview
- Sharing a work-in-progress app with a client remotely (no TestFlight required)
- Demoing an app to stakeholders without going through the App Store
- Using Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Code to vibe-code a mobile app

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install AppTuner CLI
npm install -g apptuner

# Start developing (run from your React Native project root)
apptuner start

# Or point at a specific project
apptuner start ./my-app
```

The CLI will print a QR code. Install AppTuner Mobile on your phone (App Store / Play Store), scan the QR, and your app appears instantly.

## Project Structure Requirements

AppTuner requires bare React Native projects (not Expo). The entry file must follow this exact pattern:

```javascript
// index.js — REQUIRED exactly as shown
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './App';

global.App = App;
AppRegistry.registerComponent('MyAppName', () => App);
```

Also required:
- `package.json` with `react-native` dependency
- `metro.config.js` (standard React Native metro config)
- `babel.config.js` (standard React Native babel config)
- `.apptuner.json` is auto-created by the CLI on first run

## AppTuner SDK 1.0 — Pre-installed Native Modules

AppTuner Mobile is a pre-built native shell (like Expo Go). The following native modules are pre-installed and available without adding them to package.json:

### Navigation
- `@react-navigation/native` — NavigationContainer, useNavigation, useFocusEffect
- `@react-navigation/native-stack` — createNativeStackNavigator
- `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs` — createBottomTabNavigator
- `react-native-screens` — required peer dep (pre-installed)
- `react-native-safe-area-context` — SafeAreaProvider, SafeAreaView, useSafeAreaInsets
- `react-native-gesture-handler` — GestureHandlerRootView, Gesture, etc.

### Storage
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` v3 — AsyncStorage.getItem/setItem/removeItem

### Camera & Media
- `react-native-vision-camera` — Camera component, useCameraDevice, useCameraPermission
- `react-native-image-picker` — launchImageLibrary, launchCamera

### Maps & Location
- `react-native-maps` — MapView, Marker, Polyline (AppTuner dev API key pre-configured)
- `expo-location` — Location.requestForegroundPermissionsAsync, Location.getCurrentPositionAsync

### UI & Animation
- `react-native-svg` — Svg, Circle, Rect, Path, Text, G, etc.
- `react-native-reanimated` — useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming, withSpring

### Notifications
- `@notifee/react-native` — notifee.displayNotification, notifee.createChannel

### React Native Core (always available)
- All standard RN components: View, Text, TextInput, ScrollView, FlatList, Image, TouchableOpacity, Pressable, Modal, ActivityIndicator, Switch, StatusBar, StyleSheet, Platform, Dimensions, Animated, Alert, Linking, etc.
- `react` and `react-native` — do NOT add to package.json (pre-installed in runtime)

## DO NOT Include These in package.json

SDK libraries are pre-installed in the AppTuner runtime. Adding them to package.json causes version conflicts:

```
# DO NOT add any of these to package.json:
@react-navigation/native
@react-navigation/native-stack
@react-navigation/bottom-tabs
react-native-screens
react-native-safe-area-context
react-native-gesture-handler
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage
react-native-vision-camera
react-native-image-picker
react-native-maps
expo-location
react-native-svg
react-native-reanimated
@notifee/react-native
react
react-native
```

## What is NOT Supported

These packages are NOT available in AppTuner SDK 1.0 and will fail at runtime:

- **Firebase native** (`@react-native-firebase/*`) — use the Firebase web SDK with fetch instead
- **Expo packages** (`expo-*`) except `expo-location` — AppTuner is not Expo
- **Bluetooth** (`react-native-ble-plx`, etc.)
- **NFC** (`react-native-nfc-manager`, etc.)
- **Native payments** (`@stripe/stripe-react-native`, `react-native-iap`) — coming in SDK 2.0
- **Any package requiring native code not listed above** — will fail silently or crash

## Runtime Versions

- React Native: 0.81.6
- React: 19.1.4
- SDK: 1.0

**Important:** Always use `react: 19.1.4` in your project. RN 0.81.6 ships with react-native-renderer@19.1.4. A version mismatch (e.g. react@19.2.0) causes a crash on first touch event.

## CLI Commands

```bash
apptuner start [path]   # Start Metro + watcher, connect to relay, begin hot reload
apptuner stop           # Kill all background AppTuner processes
apptuner status         # Show connection status
```

## Correct Import Patterns

```typescript
// Navigation
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs';

// Storage
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// Camera
import { Camera, useCameraDevice, useCameraPermission } from 'react-native-vision-camera';

// Image picker
import { launchImageLibrary } from 'react-native-image-picker';

// Maps
import MapView, { Marker } from 'react-native-maps';

// Location
import * as Location from 'expo-location';

// SVG
import Svg, { Circle, Rect, Path } from 'react-native-svg';

// Animation
import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle, withTiming } from 'react-native-reanimated';

// Notifications
import notifee from '@notifee/react-native';
```

## Minimal Working App Example

```typescript
// App.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello from AppTuner!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' },
  text: { fontSize: 24 },
});
```

```javascript
// index.js
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import App from './App';
global.App = App;
AppRegistry.registerComponent('MyApp', () => App);
```

```json
// package.json — note: SDK libraries NOT listed
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "apptuner start"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

## MCP Server (for AI coding tools)

AppTuner provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code. It provides AI agents with complete SDK knowledge so they generate correct code automatically.

```bash
npm install -g apptuner-mcp
```

Add to your IDE's MCP config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "apptuner": {
      "command": "apptuner-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Available MCP tools: `get_sdk_info`, `check_import`, `get_library_docs`
