## Core Strategy: Hybrid Approach {#core-strategy}

### The Problem We're Solving

**Challenge 1:** Apple takes 30% of in-app purchases
**Challenge 2:** Affiliates want fast commissions
**Challenge 3:** Users want to try before buying
**Challenge 4:** AI vibecoders iterate rapidly (hundreds of bundles/day)

### The Solution: Give Users Choice

**Why Both Options:**
- Trial path: Higher conversion rate (~30-50% of trials convert)
- Direct purchase: Instant affiliate payment (2-3 days vs 14+ days)
- Users choose their comfort level
- Affiliates get both fast AND high-converting traffic

---

## Pricing Model {#pricing-model}

### One-Time Lifetime License: $49

**Why $49:**
- Low enough for impulse purchase
- High enough to be taken seriously
- Industry standard for developer tools (Sublime Text, Tower, etc.)
- 31% commission ($15) is attractive for affiliates

### Payment Processing

**Website Payment (apptuner.com) - RECOMMENDED ✅**
```
User pays $49 on website
↓
Payment processor takes ~3% ($1.47)
↓
You keep $47.53
↓
Affiliate gets $15
↓
Your net: $32.53 (66%)
```

**App Store Payment (NOT RECOMMENDED ❌)**
```
User pays $49 in App Store
↓
Apple takes 30% ($14.70)
↓
You keep $34.30
↓
Affiliate gets $15
↓
Your net: $19.30 (39%)
```

**Savings: $13.23 per sale by avoiding App Store payments!**

### Legal Approach

**100% LEGAL because AppTuner is a professional developer tool (B2B software):**

✅ **ALLOWED in app:**
- "Enter License Key" field
- "Get Pro features at apptuner.com"
- Settings screen with upgrade prompt

❌ **NOT ALLOWED in app:**
- Direct "Buy Now" button linking to website
- In-app payment form
- Price displayed next to upgrade prompts

**Real-world examples using this model:**
- GitHub (free app, paid plans on website)
- Sketch (free viewer, paid license on website)
- Figma (free app, paid plans on website)
- Tower Git Client (free app, paid license on website)

---

## Affiliate Commission Structure {#affiliate-commission}

### Standard Commission: $15 per sale (31%)

**How it works:**

**Path A: Free Trial → Paid**
```
1. User clicks affiliate link
2. Downloads app (free)
3. Uses for 14 days
4. Upgrades to paid ($49)
5. Affiliate credited: $15 (14-30 days after click)

Expected conversion: 30-50% of trials
```

**Path B: Direct Purchase**
```
1. User clicks affiliate link
2. Pays $49 immediately on website
3. Affiliate credited: $15 (2-3 days after purchase)

Expected conversion: 2-5% of all visitors
```

### Tiered Commission (Optional Incentive)

**Reward top-performing affiliates:**

```
TIER 1: 0-10 sales/month
→ $15 per sale (31%)

TIER 2: 11-50 sales/month
→ $20 per sale (41%)

TIER 3: 50+ sales/month
→ $25 per sale (51%)

BONUS: $50 for every 20th sale
```

**Why tiered commissions work:**
- Motivates affiliates to push harder
- Top performers get rewarded
- Creates affiliate loyalty
- Competitive advantage vs flat-rate programs

### Affiliate Terms

```
Cookie Duration: 90 days (generous!)
Attribution: Last-click
Payment Terms: Net-30 (30 days after sale)
Payment Methods: PayPal, Stripe, Wire Transfer
Minimum Payout: $50 (≈3-4 sales)
Tracking: First-party cookies + backend validation
```

---

## Free Tier Design {#free-tier}

### The Critical Question: What to Limit?

**Problem:** Auto-reload sends hundreds of bundles per session
- Counting individual bundles = punishing the main feature
- Time-based trials = Standard but imprecise
- Session-based = Fair but complex

### Recommended Free Tier: Time-Based Trial

```
AppTuner Free (14-day trial):
✅ All features unlocked
✅ Unlimited bundles
✅ Unlimited devices
✅ Console logging
✅ Error overlay
✅ Hot reload
✅ Everything works!

After 14 days:
→ "Trial ended. Unlock lifetime access for $49"
```

**Why this is best:**
1. **Simple to understand:** "Free for 2 weeks, then $49 forever"
2. **No bundle counting:** Users can iterate freely
3. **Fair evaluation:** 14 days is enough to build a real project
4. **Industry standard:** Matches competitor trials
5. **High conversion:** Users get hooked in 2 weeks

### Alternative: Session-Based (Advanced)

```
AppTuner Free:
✅ First 30 development sessions
✅ Unlimited bundles per session
✅ Session = connect to disconnect (or 1-hour idle timeout)

After 30 sessions:
→ "You've completed 30 sessions. Unlock unlimited for $49"
```

**Why session-based:**
- Prevents abuse (can't use free forever by disconnecting)
- Fair for part-time developers (30 sessions = 2-4 weeks of work)
- Encourages focused work sessions
- More complex to implement

**Recommended: Start with 14-day trial, iterate to sessions if needed**

---

## Why This Works for Affiliates {#why-it-works}

### What Dev Bloggers Care About

**Priority 1: Conversion Rate (30-50% trial → paid)**
```
1000 visitors click affiliate link
↓
100 start free trial (10% conversion)
↓
40 upgrade to paid (40% trial conversion)
↓
40 × $15 = $600 commission

Per-click value: $0.60
```

**Priority 2: Commission Amount ($15 = 31%)**
```
Comparison:
- Amazon Affiliates: 1-4% commission
- Typical SaaS: 20-25% commission
- Digital products: 30-50% commission
- AppTuner: 31% ($15 on $49) ✅

This is COMPETITIVE and ATTRACTIVE
```

**Priority 3: Product Quality (Does it work?)**
```
✅ Solves real pain point (Xcode rebuild hell)
✅ Target audience is clear (React Native developers)
✅ Easy to explain ("Hot reload without Xcode")
✅ Genuine value = Easy to promote
```

### Why 14-Day Trial is NOT Too Long

**Industry comparison:**
```
- Figma: 14-30 days
- JetBrains IDEs: 30 days
- GitHub Copilot: 30 days
- Sketch: 30 days
- Adobe Creative Cloud: 7 days
- VS Code extensions: Often no trial (freemium forever)

AppTuner: 14 days = SHORTER than most ✅
```

**What affiliates ACTUALLY care about:**
- NOT trial length
- YES conversion rate
- YES commission percentage
- YES product quality

**Affiliates PREFER trials** because:
- Higher conversion than direct purchase (30-50% vs 2-5%)
- Users try → love it → buy it
- Better for their reputation (they recommended something good)
